# **Lesson 1: Understanding Computer Networks & The Internet**  

You must have heard a lot of terminologies like **web requests, APIs, LAN, VPN**, and all that other jazz. Don't worry! In this very first lesson, we'll get familiar with the **basics and terminologies**.  

This might seem **complicated** to a beginner, and it's natural to feel **overwhelmed** when facing a concept with an enormous number of topics.  
That’s why we'll learn about **computer networks in layers**—but what does it mean? 

It means **we'll group similar topics together**, making learning **much easier** and more structured.

## **What is the Internet?**  

"Internet" is a term that everyone knows, but not everyone can describe it.  
- Is it **Google**?  
- Is it **anything online**?  
- Is it just **websites**?  

Well, it’s none of these! You may have heard that the **Internet is a "Network of Networks"**, and that's actually true! But to understand why, let’s first break it down in a simple way.  

---

## **A Nuts-and-Bolts Description**  

If the Internet is a **tool**, then it must have some **nuts and bolts**, right?  
Yes! These **nuts and bolts** are the **hardware and software components** that make up the Internet.  

A more **technical definition** of the Internet is:  

> **"The Internet can be described as a networking infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications."**  

So, what does that mean?  

- The **public Internet** is a **worldwide "computer network"**.  
- It interconnects **millions** of devices: computers, routers, servers, mobile phones, and much more.  
- **Most of these devices are "servers"**—they **store** and **transmit** information like emails, images, and files.  

---

## *Wait... Does That Mean Our Devices Are Servers?*

By this definition, does that mean **your smartphone or laptop is a server**?  
**NO!** There’s a key **difference** between a **server** and a **host (end system)**.  

### **Let’s Use an Analogy!**  
Imagine a **restaurant**:  
- A **server** (waiter) **provides food** to customers.  
- A **customer** (you) **requests and consumes** food.  

In networking terms:  
- A **server** **stores** and **serves** data to others.  
- A **host (end system)** **requests and consumes** data.  

So while **all servers are hosts**, **not all hosts are servers**.  

---

## **What About Internet Applications?**  

The Internet applications **we use daily**, like:  
- **The Web (WWW)**  
- **Email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)**  
- **Streaming (Netflix, YouTube, etc.)**  

These are called **Network Application Programs**. They run on **end systems (hosts)** and allow us to **send and receive data** over the Internet.  

---

## **Communication Links**  

- Hosts are connected together by something we call *Communication Links*. These can be made of:
  - Coaxial cables  
  - Copper wires  
  - Fiber optics  
  - Radio spectrum  
  
  Different links can transmit data at different rates/speeds. The speed/rate of link transmission is called *link bandwidth* and is measured in **bits per second**.

---

## **Routers & The Role of ISPs**  

- Usually, hosts are not directly connected to each other via a single communication link. Instead, they are connected through intermediate switching devices known as *routers*. 
- The router you have at home (with a green light) is just a *home router*, but there are many types of routers. 

### **How Do ISPs Provide Data?**

Many people misunderstand how data is provided. If you have a **2GB daily data plan**, that doesn’t mean you are *given* 2GB of actual content. It means:
- You can **request and receive** up to 2GB worth of data before your ISP either stops your connection or slows it down significantly.
- Every action online (watching videos, sending messages, downloading files) consumes some of this data.
- ISPs (like Jio, Airtel, etc.) regulate your data usage based on your plan. 

A *router* itself **does not provide the internet**; it simply distributes the connection within your local network. The **ISP** is the one providing access to the internet.  

---

## **How Do Routers Handle Data?**  

Routers do **not** store data permanently; instead, they *route* it. When you upload a 1GB file, the router:
1. Breaks it into small *packets* (e.g., 100MB each).
2. Sends them across the internet to the destination.

These packets are **not necessarily sent through the same path**. They take different routes depending on network congestion.

---

## **How Do We Reassemble Data?**  

Good question! The **router doesn’t reassemble the data**—it just sends packets. The **receiving device** (your computer, phone, or server) is responsible for putting the packets back together.

Each packet consists of:
- A **header** (contains source & destination address + sequence number)
- The **actual data** (or a part of it)
- A **footer** (sometimes used for error checking)

Since packets can take **different routes**, they might arrive **out of order**. The receiving device uses the *sequence numbers* to **reassemble them correctly**.

---

## **How Do Packets Travel?**  

> Suppose I send a **200MB audio file** from the **Atlantic to Antarctica**. 

You might think that all packets travel via **South America**. But that's **wrong**! 

Routers dynamically choose the best route:
- Some packets may go through **South America**.
- Others may travel via **Africa** or **Mid-Atlantic islands**.
- This depends on *network congestion* and *routing protocols*.

Routing decisions are made using **protocols** such as:
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** We'll discuss them later.
