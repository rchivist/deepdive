# **Lesson 1: Understanding Computer Networks & The Internet**  

You must have heard a lot of terminologies like **web requests, APIs, LAN, VPN**, and all that other jazz. Don't worry! In this very first lesson, we'll get familiar with the **basics and terminologies**.  

This might seem **complicated** to a beginner, and it's natural to feel **overwhelmed** when facing a concept with an enormous number of topics.  
That’s why we'll learn about **computer networks in layers**—but what does it mean? 

It means **we'll group similar topics together**, making learning **much easier** and more structured.

## **What is the Internet?**  

"Internet" is a term that everyone knows, but not everyone can describe it.  
- Is it **Google**?  
- Is it **anything online**?  
- Is it just **websites**?  

Well, it’s none of these! You may have heard that the **Internet is a "Network of Networks"**, and that's actually true! But to understand why, let’s first break it down in a simple way.  

---

## **A Nuts-and-Bolts Description**  

If the Internet is a **tool**, then it must have some **nuts and bolts**, right?  
Yes! These **nuts and bolts** are the **hardware and software components** that make up the Internet.  

A more **technical definition** of the Internet is:  

> **"The Internet can be described as a networking infrastructure that provides services to distributed applications."**  

So, what does that mean?  

- The **public Internet** is a **worldwide "computer network"**.  
- It interconnects **millions** of devices: computers, routers, servers, mobile phones, and much more.  
- **Most of these devices are "servers"**—they **store** and **transmit** information like emails, images, and files.  

---

## *Wait... Does That Mean Our Devices Are Servers?*

By this definition, does that mean **your smartphone or laptop is a server**?  
**NO!** There’s a key **difference** between a **server** and a **host (end system)**.  

### **Let’s Use an Analogy!**  
Imagine a **restaurant**:  
- A **server** (waiter) **provides food** to customers.  
- A **customer** (you) **requests and consumes** food.  

In networking terms:  
- A **server** **stores** and **serves** data to others.  
- A **host (end system)** **requests and consumes** data.  

So while **all servers are hosts**, **not all hosts are servers**.  

---

## **What About Internet Applications?**  

The Internet applications **we use daily**, like:  
- **The Web (WWW)**  
- **Email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)**  
- **Streaming (Netflix, YouTube, etc.)**  

These are called **Network Application Programs**. They run on **end systems (hosts)** and allow us to **send and receive data** over the Internet.  

---

## **Communication Links**  

- Hosts are connected together by something we call *Communication Links*. These can be made of:
  - Coaxial cables  
  - Copper wires  
  - Fiber optics  
  - Radio spectrum  
  
  Different links can transmit data at different rates/speeds. The speed/rate of link transmission is called *link bandwidth* and is measured in **bits per second**.

---

## **Routers & The Role of ISPs**  

- Usually, hosts are not directly connected to each other via a single communication link. Instead, they are connected through intermediate switching devices known as *routers*. 
- The router you have at home (with a green light) is just a *home router*, but there are many types of routers. 

### **How Do ISPs Provide Data?**

Many people misunderstand how data is provided. If you have a **2GB daily data plan**, that doesn’t mean you are *given* 2GB of actual content. It means:
- You can **request and receive** up to 2GB worth of data before your ISP either stops your connection or slows it down significantly.
- Every action online (watching videos, sending messages, downloading files) consumes some of this data.
- ISPs (like Jio, Airtel, etc.) regulate your data usage based on your plan. 

A *router* itself **does not provide the internet**; it simply distributes the connection within your local network. The **ISP** is the one providing access to the internet.  

---

## **How Do Routers Handle Data?**  

Routers do **not** store data permanently; instead, they *route* it. When you upload a 1GB file, the router:
1. Breaks it into small *packets* (e.g., 100MB each).
2. Sends them across the internet to the destination.

These packets are **not necessarily sent through the same path**. They take different routes depending on network congestion.

---

## **How Do We Reassemble Data?**  

Good question! The **router doesn’t reassemble the data**—it just sends packets. The **receiving device** (your computer, phone, or server) is responsible for putting the packets back together.

Each packet consists of:
- A **header** (contains source & destination address + sequence number)
- The **actual data** (or a part of it)
- A **footer** (sometimes used for error checking)

Since packets can take **different routes**, they might arrive **out of order**. The receiving device uses the *sequence numbers* to **reassemble them correctly**.

---

## **How Do Packets Travel?**  

> Suppose I send a **200MB audio file** from the **Atlantic to Antarctica**. 

You might think that all packets travel via **South America**. But that's **wrong**! 

Routers dynamically choose the best route:
- Some packets may go through **South America**.
- Others may travel via **Africa** or **Mid-Atlantic islands**.
- This depends on *network congestion* and *routing protocols*.

Routing decisions are made using **protocols** such as:
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** We'll discuss them later.


# Packet Switching

Rather than providing a dedicated path between hosts, the internet uses a technique known as *packet switching* 
that allows multiple communicating hosts to share a path, or parts of a path at the same time. We discussed this earlier so a definition would be: *A packet switching is the process of breaking data into packets and sending them individually across a network. each packet can take a different router to reach the destination.

> Imagine it like this, you have to send a large package that has many many small accessories. you can either use one single postman and deliever it one by one. or you can just use multiple postmen to send it all at the same time!!

-> The transferring of packets sequentially one by one is called *circuit switching*
-> The transferring of packets seperately at the same time through different locations is called *packet switching*.

The Internet isn’t just one big network—it’s an interconnected system of privately and publicly owned networks. **[Network of Networks]**  

It includes:

- Private networks (like corporate data centers, universities).  
- Public networks (like your ISP’s network or cloud providers).  
- Your devices, routers, and servers, all contributing to this global web of connections.  

Basically, if it connects to a network and communicates over the Internet, it plays a part in forming this massive system.  

For a network to be part of the Internet, it must use the **IP protocol (Internet Protocol)**. This means:

- Every device—phones, laptops, routers, servers—must have an IP address to communicate.  
- Even if you keep your network private (like a home or office network), it still requires IP to function.  
- That’s why IP is often called the **"Internet Dial Tone"**—it’s the fundamental layer that makes everything work.  

You can hide your IP using VPNs, firewalls, or private networks, but your device still has an IP at some level.  

### **Does the Internet Have a Structure?**  
Yes!  
The Internet isn’t just a chaotic web of connections—it follows a **hierarchical structure**, known as the **Topology of the Internet**.

### **At the Lowest Level**
Your devices (phones, computers, smart TVs) connect to the Internet through your **ISP** (like Jio, Airtel, Verizon) via something called **access networks**.

#### **What Are Access Networks?**

- **Access networks** connect your home, office, or organization to the Internet through an ISP.
- They include **Wi-Fi, fiber optics, DSL, and mobile data networks (4G, 5G)**.

> **Does your home router handle everything?**  
> **Nope!** Your router is just the **middleman**. It connects you to your **ISP’s network**, and they take care of the rest.

So, **access networks bridge the gap** between your local devices and the ISP, which then routes your traffic across the Internet. Depending on where your data needs to go, it might have to pass through different levels of networks.

---
### **The Internet’s Hierarchy – Tiered Networks**

The Internet isn’t just a big mess of cables—there’s a structure to how everything connects! We’ve got different levels of networks handling different parts of the journey:

1. **Tier 3 Networks (Local ISPs)** → These are the ISPs that connect directly to users like you and me (home, school, office). They handle local traffic within towns and cities.

2. **Tier 2 Networks (Regional ISPs)** → These guys connect multiple Tier 3 networks. They move data between cities and states.

3. **Tier 1 Networks (Backbone Providers)** → These are the big boys. They provide global connectivity and handle traffic across continents. Regular users don’t connect to them instead these are used by big tech companies.

---
### **So What Do These Actually Do?**

If you're sending a video to a friend in the same town, it’s simple. Your data stays within the **Tier 3 network**—no need for anything fancy.

But let’s say your friend is in another state. Now, things change:

- First, your data goes from **your router → Tier 3 ISP**.
- Then, it jumps up to a **Tier 2 ISP**, which handles state-wide traffic.
- Finally, it reaches **your friend’s Tier 3 ISP**, which delivers it to their router and device.

Tier 1 networks? They don’t get involved in small stuff like this. These guys are handling major international traffic, connecting entire countries, and making sure global companies like Google and Amazon can talk to each other.

---
### **How Data Travels Across the Internet**

Whenever you do something online (like open a website or send a message), here’s what’s actually happening:

1. **Your device** sends data to your home **router**.
2. **The router** passes it to your **ISP (Tier 3 network)**.
3. If your data needs to travel further, it goes to a **regional ISP (Tier 2)** and then back down to the **Tier 3 ISP** near your destination.
4. The data reaches the destination **server**, which then sends a response following the same path in reverse.


Now we have established that internet is "Network of Networks" Means it's really massive and on a global level.
> You must be wondering how does it handles billions of devices perfectly? Why doesn't it send something by error to someone else? Most common answer is IP Address as we talked about them earlier and it'd be correct but there is a lot going on. Let's take a look
