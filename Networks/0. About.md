### Hello and Welcome!

In these lessons we will discuss about 'Computer Networking'.

##### We'll dive about these into fair depth. Keep in mind that a basic knowledge of C Programming is necessary, You can read theory and stuff without it but it'll be difficult to understand some topics.

##### Keep in mind that i am not an expert into any of this. I am just a random person sharing what i have learned.
So if you find anything incorrect in these lessons  feel free to raise an issue!
