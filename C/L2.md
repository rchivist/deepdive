# What Happens After We Run the Program?

If you're running your program by clicking the ▶️ button, stop for a moment and understand what is actually happening.

> **Tip:** The more you understand how things work, the better programmer you'll become. Avoid mindlessly pressing buttons—learn what they do!

## What is the ▶️ Button Doing?

The ▶️ button is using a **GCC wrapper**. Remember when you installed the GNU compiler? That button is just a wrapper for it.

## What is a Wrapper?

A **wrapper** is a script or program that acts as an intermediary between the user and the actual **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** compiler. Instead of interacting with the compiler manually, you just click a button, and it handles everything for you.

But since we are here to **learn**, let's do it the manual way!

## Manually Compiling a C Program

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
gcc -o <output_file_name> <your_c_file>.c
```

### Breaking It Down:

- `gcc` – Calls the GCC compiler.
- `-o <output_file_name>` – Specifies the name of the compiled output file.
- `<your_c_file>.c` – The source file you want to compile.

For example, if your file is `hello.c`, run:

```bash
gcc -o hello hello.c
```

Now, you'll see a new file named `hello` (without `.c`). This is your **machine code**.

## Running the Compiled Program

To execute it, type:

```bash
./hello
```

You should see:

```bash
Hello, World!
```

Now you understand what happens behind the scenes when you run a C program. And now we'll learn basics of the programming.

> **Tip:** If you're a beginner then I am sure you're also worried about people around you saying that *"don't learn this language, learn Python, learn Java, don't listen to others learn JavaScript"*. Then let me assure you it won't matter what you learn because the definition of function, and other stuff like variable, arguments, etc., all remain the same in every language. Learning C is recommended first because it'll tell you what's happening under the hood!

# Variables and Statements

Did you know that in memory every block of memory has a name or address? I mean, how will a system recognize it if it doesn't have a name? Do you want to see how it looks? Here you go: `0x7ffee6b8a9dc`.

I am sure half of you will think of quitting programming after reading such a cryptic text, and what if you had to write three of these just to add two numbers? It looks so inefficient, right? Well, don't worry, we won't have to do this because we have a much more interesting thing—Variables!

Basically, instead of cryptic names, we can just give it a simple one, like how we name humans! I mean, you won't see a human named with the first 10 initials of their DNA; we call them Susan or Rohit. That's what a variable is. We can name them anything (while following a few rules we'll get to later).

So, a variable is a name of some data that's stored in memory at some address.

## Rules:

You can use any characters in the range `0-9, A-Z, a-z`, and underscore `_` for variable names, with the following rules:

- You **can’t** start a variable with a digit `0-9`.
- You **can’t** start a variable name with two underscores `__`.
- You **can’t** start a variable name with an underscore `_` followed by a capital `A-Z`.

## Variable Types

We have established what variables are, but you might be wondering how a program recognizes if we want to store a number, string, decimal value, or a character? That's where **Variable Types** come in. Before you can use a variable, you have to tell C what type of data it holds—Is it a number? A character? A decimal value? What is it???

Here are some of the most basic types:

| Type               | Example        | C Type  |
|--------------------|--------------|---------|
| Integer           | 3490         | `int`   |
| Floating point    | 3.14159      | `float` |
| Character (single) | 'c'          | `char`  |
| String            | "Hello, world!" | `char *` |

How do we declare it? Like this:

```c
int number;
```

This line tells our compiler that we want to store an integer value and we are naming that cryptic address "number".

### Example: Adding Two Numbers

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int number1 = 12; // Assigning value to variable number1 
    float number2 = 23.234;
    float solution = number1 + number2; // Storing sum of the two numbers

    printf("%f\n", solution);
}
```

### Breaking It Down:

- `int number1 = 12;` – Declaring and initializing an integer variable.
- `float number2 = 23.234;` – Declaring and initializing a float variable.
- `float solution = number1 + number2;` – Adding an `int` and a `float`, and storing the result in a `float` variable.
- `printf("%f\n", solution);` – Printing the result.

### Why is the output a float when adding an int and a float?

When you add an `int` and a `float`, the output is a `float` because of **implicit type conversion**, also known as **type promotion**. This happens to maintain accuracy in the result.

### Type Promotion in C

In C, when you perform arithmetic operations on mixed data types, the lower precision type (`int`) is automatically converted to the higher precision type (`float`) before the operation is executed. This ensures that no data is lost due to truncation.

### What Happens Internally:

1. The compiler sees that we are adding an `int` (`number1`) and a `float` (`number2`).
2. Before performing the operation, it converts the integer (`12`) into a float (`12.0`).
3. Now the addition happens between two float values:

   ```c
   12.0 (float) + 23.234 (float) = 35.234 (float)
   ```

4. The result is stored as a `float`.

You can also **control** this type conversion! It's called **Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting)**—but we'll learn that later!
