# What Happens After We Run the Program?

If you're running your program by clicking the ▶️ button, stop for a moment and understand what is actually happening.

> **Tip:** The more you understand how things work, the better programmer you'll become. Avoid mindlessly pressing buttons—learn what they do!

### What is the ▶️ Button Doing?

The ▶️ button is using a **GCC wrapper**. Remember when you installed the GNU compiler? That button is just a wrapper for it.

### What is a Wrapper?

A **wrapper** is a script or program that acts as an intermediary between the user and the actual **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** compiler. Instead of interacting with the compiler manually, you just click a button, and it handles everything for you.

But since we are here to **learn**, let's do it the manual way!

### Manually Compiling a C Program

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
gcc -o <output_file_name> <your_c_file>.c
```

### Breaking It Down:

- `gcc` – Calls the GCC compiler.
- `-o <output_file_name>` – Specifies the name of the compiled output file.
- `<your_c_file>.c` – The source file you want to compile.

For example, if your file is `hello.c`, run:

```bash
gcc -o hello hello.c
```

Now, you'll see a new file named `hello` (without `.c`). This is your **machine code**.

### Running the Compiled Program

To execute it, type:

```bash
./hello
```

You should see:

```bash
Hello, World!
```

Now you understand what happens behind the scenes when you run a C program. And now we'll learn basics of the programming

> **Tip:** If you're a beginner then i am sure you're also worried  about people around you saying that *"don't learn this language, learn python, learn java, don't listen to others learn Javascript"*. Then let me assure you
> it won't matter what you learn because the definition of function, and other stuff like variable, arguments, etc.
> it all remains the same! in every language and learning C is recommended first because it'll tell you what's happening under the hood!

# Variables and Statements

Did you know in a memory every block of  memory has a name/ address?? i mean how a system will recognize it if it does'nt have a name. do you want to see how it looks like? here you go ```0x7ffee6b8a9dc```.
I am sure half of you will think of quitting programming after reading such a cryptic text and what if you have to write three of these just to add 2 numbers? it looks so inefficient right? well don't worry we won't have to do this because we have much more interesting thing -Variables-!. Basically instead of cryptic names we can just give it a simple like we name humans! i mean you won't see a human named with its first 10 initials of his/ her DNA, we call them susan or rohit. that's what a variable is. we can name them anything { while following few rules we'll get to this later}. 
So a variable is a name of some data that's stored in memory at some address.

### Rules:

    You can use any characters in the range 0-9, A-Z, a-z, and underscore for variable names, with the following rules:

    You can’t start a variable with a digit 0-9.
    You can’t start a variable name with two underscores.
    You can’t start a variable name with an underscore followed by a capital A-Z.

## Variable Types 

We have established what are variables but you might be wondering how will a program recognize if we want to store a number, string, decimal value or a character?
That's where Variable Types come in. Before you can use a varible you have to tell C, what type of variable it holds aka is it a number? is it a character? is it a decimal value? what is it???
here are some of the most basic types:
| Type               | Example        | C Type  |
|--------------------|--------------|---------|
| Integer           | 3490         | `int`   |
| Floating point    | 3.14159      | `float` |
| Character (single) | 'c'          | `char`  |
| String           | "Hello, world!" | `char *` |

How do we declare it? like this -
```c
int number;
```
This line tells our compiler that i want to store a integer value and i am naming that cryptic address "number"
let's see a program of adding two numbers.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
    int test; // this is how we write it
    int number1 = 12; // assigning value to the variable named number1 
    int number2 = 23;
    int solution = number1 + number2; // creating a new variable and storing sum of the other two

    printf(number1 + number2);
}
```
Let's see what's going on here

```int test;``` this is how we declare a variable meaning we told out compiler that this is a variable that's gonna
store a integer value. [ if you store anything else our compiler will throw in an error ]
