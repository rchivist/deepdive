# What Happens After We Run the Program?

If you're running your program by clicking the ▶️ button, stop for a moment and understand what is actually happening.

> **Tip:** The more you understand how things work, the better programmer you'll become. Avoid mindlessly pressing buttons—learn what they do!

## What is the ▶️ Button Doing?

The ▶️ button is using a **GCC wrapper**. Remember when you installed the GNU compiler? That button is just a wrapper for it.

## What is a Wrapper?

A **wrapper** is a script or program that acts as an intermediary between the user and the actual **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** compiler. Instead of interacting with the compiler manually, you just click a button, and it handles everything for you. Basically, it's a button when you press it a program runs that tells compiler -- "This is the code and i want you to run it!"


## Manually Compiling a C Program

Open your terminal{Ctrl + J} and type:

```bash
gcc -o <some random name> <your_c_file>.c
```

### Breaking It Down:

- `gcc` – Calls the GCC compiler.
- `-o <some random name>` - Something you want to name the new file
- `<your_c_file>.c` – The source file you want to compile.

For example, Suppose my file is `hello.c`, and i ran:

```bash
gcc -o hello hello.c
```

If you do this too, you'll see a new file named `hello` (without `.c`). This is your **machine code**. Don't try to open it you'll just see cryptic looking letter that won't make any sense.

## Running the Compiled Program

To execute it, type:

```bash
./hello
```

You should see:

```bash
Hello, World!
```

*Note:* How do these commands work? Do i have to use space like we did in `gcc <space> -o <space> hello <space> hello.c`? and the answer is yes!

> Suppose you're talking to a friend via messages. If you type like "idontknowifiwillattendschooltomorrow" he'll never understand what are you trying to say.. Instead you type like "i don't know if i will attend school tomorrow".
Similarly, The (terminal) treats spaces as separators between different parts of the command. If you write:

`gcc-ohellohello.c`

It will not work because the shell thinks `gcc-ohellohello.c` is a single word (which doesn’t exist). if you want to understand how commands work in more detail you can refer to [This link about commands](https://youtu.be/2P7fcVHxA9o?si=JXKXeeqI0YVkzbpw). and [This link for crash course on command-lines](https://youtu.be/yz7nYlnXLfE?si=YnFMi9icpVaSm4pJ). It's not important to watch these right away you can watch them in your free time or when you feel like it.

Now you understand what happens behind the scenes when you run a C program. You might be wondering—"If this was machine code, why didn’t I see 0s and 1s?"

That’s a great question! And I also know you didn’t think of it, but I’ll answer it anyway.

   > Those are 0s and 1s, but when I say 0s and 1s, I don’t mean literal letters—those are binary instructions, not strings! For you, they appear as 0s and 1s, but for a computer, it all comes down to on and off. This might not make sense to you now, but you’ll understand what I mean soon.

So, back to the answer… As I said, these are binary instructions, but our IDE doesn’t know that. It tries to interpret those 0s and 1s as characters, which results in cryptic symbols like @ ! $ #.

> **Tip:** If you're a beginner then I am sure you're also worried about people around you saying that *"don't learn this language, learn Python, learn Java, don't listen to others learn JavaScript"*. Then let me assure you it won't matter what you learn because the definition of function, and other stuff like variable, arguments, etc., all remain the same in every language. Which means... When you finish Learning C and move on to some other language you won't have to learn stuff again and again! all you would have to do is just simply see some tutorials, realise syntax of code and you'll be good to go. Learning C is recommended first because it'll tell you what's happening under the hood and you might feel like that there's no need but you are wrong!
