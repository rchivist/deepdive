# Variables and Statements

Did you know that in memory every block of memory has a name or address? I mean, how will a system recognize it if it doesn't have a name? Do you want to see how it looks? Here you go: `0x7ffee6b8a9dc`.

I am sure half of you will think of quitting programming after reading such a cryptic text, and what if you had to write three of these just to add two numbers? It looks so inefficient, right? Well, don't worry, we won't have to do this because we have a much more interesting thing—Variables!

Basically, instead of cryptic names, we can just give it a simple one, like how we name humans! I mean, you won't see a human named with the first 10 initials of their DNA; we call them Susan or Rohit. That's what a variable is. We can name them anything (while following a few rules we'll get to later).

So, a variable is a name of some data that's stored in memory at some address.

## Rules:

You can use any characters in the range `0-9, A-Z, a-z`, and underscore `_` for variable names, with the following rules:

- You **can’t** start a variable with a digit `0-9`.
- You **can’t** start a variable name with two underscores `__`.
- You **can’t** start a variable name with an underscore `_` followed by a capital `A-Z`.

## Variable Types

We have established what variables are, but you might be wondering how a program recognizes if we want to store a number, string, decimal value, or a character? That's where **Variable Types** come in. Before you can use a variable, you have to tell C what type of data it holds—Is it a number? A character? A decimal value? What is it???

Here are some of the most basic types:

| Type               | Example        | C Type  |
|--------------------|--------------|---------|
| Integer           | 3490         | `int`   |
| Floating point    | 3.14159      | `float` |
| Character (single) | 'c'          | `char`  |
| String            | "Hello, world!" | `char *` |

How do we declare it? Like this:

```c
int number;
```

This line tells our compiler that we want to store an integer value and we are naming that cryptic address "number".

### Example: Adding Two Numbers

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int number1 = 12; // Assigning value to variable number1 
    float number2 = 23.234;
    float solution = number1 + number2; // Storing sum of the two numbers

    printf("%f\n", solution);
}
```

### Breaking It Down:

- `int number1 = 12;` – Declaring and initializing an integer variable.
- `float number2 = 23.234;` – Declaring and initializing a float variable.
- `float solution = number1 + number2;` – Adding an `int` and a `float`, and storing the result in a `float` variable.
- `printf("%f\n", solution);` – Printing the result.
- What's this %f? we'll talk about this later and yes it's really important.

### Why is the output a float when adding an int and a float?

When you add an `int` and a `float`, the output is a `float` because of **implicit type conversion**, also known as **type promotion**. This happens to maintain accuracy in the result.

### Type Promotion in C

In C, when you perform arithmetic operations on mixed data types, the lower precision type (`int`) is automatically converted to the higher precision type (`float`) before the operation is executed. This ensures that no data is lost due to truncation.

### What Happens Internally:

1. The compiler sees that we are adding an `int` (`number1`) and a `float` (`number2`).
2. Before performing the operation, it converts the integer (`12`) into a float (`12.0`).
3. Now the addition happens between two float values:

   ```c
   12.0 (float) + 23.234 (float) = 35.234 (float)
   ```

4. The result is stored as a `float`.

You can also **control** this type conversion! It's called **Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting)**—but we'll learn that later!

## Boolean Types
 
C has Boolean Types, true or false.
**zero** means "false" and **non-zero** means "true".
we can use these guys to 
    1. run infinite loops. { what are loops? we'll get to that later }
    2. check existence of a value somewhere, etc.

# Operators and Expressions

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on values. When you go into more detail, these will be very useful, so remember them.

## Arithmetic Operators

These are basic mathematical operators.

```c
addition = 23 + 12; // Sum of numbers
subtraction = 23 - 12; // Subtraction of numbers
multiplication = 23 * 12; // Multiplication of numbers
division = 23 / 12; // Division of numbers
modulo = 23 % 12; // Remainder of division
```

For exponentiation (power), we use the `pow()` function from `<math.h>`, just like we used `printf()` from `<stdio.h>`.

```c
power = pow(23, 12); // 23 ^ 12, meaning 23 will be multiplied 12 times
```

## Ternary Operators

These are used in expressions where the value depends on the result of a conditional statement embedded in it.

```c
y = y + (x > 10 ? 12 : 23);
```

Seems complicated? Let's break it down.
It means that if `x > 10`, add `12` to `y`, otherwise add `23`.

```c
int x = 2;
printf("The number %d is %s.\n", x, x % 2 == 0 ? "even" : "odd");
```

Try to guess what the output will be before running it but before that what the heck is %d and %s?? we earlier saw %f too. So what is it?

## Format Specifiers

These are placeholders in `printf()` and `scanf()` (input/output) functions that indicate the type of data being read or printed.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number = 234;
    printf("The number is %d, also two hundred and thirty-four", number);
    return 0;
}
```

Different data types have different format specifiers. Here's a table:

| Format Specifier | Data Type | Example Output |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------|
| `%d` or `%i`    | Integer (`int`) | 42 |
| `%f`           | Floating point (`float`) | 3.141593 |
| `%.2f`         | Floating point (2 decimal places) | 3.14 |
| `%c`           | Character (`char`) | A |
| `%s`           | String (`char[]`) | "Hello" |
| `%u`           | Unsigned int | 12345 |
| `%ld`          | Long int | 1234567890 |
| `%lu`          | Unsigned long int | 4294967295 |
| `%x` or `%X`   | Hexadecimal | 1a or 1A |
| `%o`           | Octal | 52 |
| `%p`           | Pointer address | 0x7ffeefbcd123 |
| `%zu`          | `size_t` (for `sizeof()`) | 4 |

Notice how i've introduced you several new data types and their format specifiers. Don't worry we'll learn those too.

Now back to our earlier question. What's the output of this expression?

```c
int x = 2;
printf("The number %d is %s.\n", x, x % 2 == 0 ? "even" : "odd");
```

The output will be **even!** Since `x % 2` gives `0`, the condition evaluates to `true`, and we print "even". If `x` were an odd number, we would print "odd" instead.

## Pre-and-Post Increment-and-Decrement

Let's establish a few things before introducing this topic.

```c
i = i + 1;
```
This is the same as:
```c
i++;
i += 1;
```

**AND**

```c
1 = 1 + i;
```
This is the same as:
```c
++i;
1 += i;
```

Same applies to other arithmetic operators, but here we focus on increment (add) and decrement (subtract).

```c
i++; // Add one to i (post-increment)
i--; // Subtract one from i (post-decrement)
```

### Post-Increment and Post-Decrement
In **post-increment/decrement**, the value of the expression is first computed with the current value of `i`, and then `i` is incremented or decremented **after** the expression is evaluated.

If `i = 9`, then after `i++`, `i` will be `10`.

### Pre-Increment and Pre-Decrement
```c
++i; // Add one to i (pre-increment)
--i; // Subtract one from i (pre-decrement)
```

In **pre-increment/decrement**, `i` is incremented or decremented **before** the expression is evaluated.

If `i = 9`, then after `++i`, `i` will be `10` **before** being used in any expression.

We can actually embed them in expressions, like this:
```c
i = 100;
j = 10 + i++; // i++ will be 101 and adding with 10 will result in 111
```
Try to print these on your own and play around with the expressions.

## The Comma Operator

These are pretty simple, so just read them—you'll learn about them easily as you code.

```c
int x, y; // Assigning int to both x and y in the same line
```

```c
x = 100, y = 12; // First assign 100 to x and then assign 12 to y at the same time, in the same line
```

But you're wondering how this is any different from writing:

```c
x = 100; 
y = 12;
```

Well, it **is** different! These are two expressions separated by semicolons, while the former one is a **single expression** using the comma operator.

---

## Conditional Operators

These are used for boolean values. You'll come to love them as you start using conditional statements like `{ if-else, if-else-if, switch }`. (More on these later.)

```c
x == y;  // True if x is equivalent to y
x != y;  // True if x is not equivalent to y
x < y;   // True if x is less than y
x > y;   // True if x is greater than y
x >= y;  // True if x is either greater than or equal to y
x <= y;  // True if x is either smaller than or equal to y
```

> **Tip:** Don't confuse assignment (`=`) with comparison (`==`). These two are different—one is used to assign values, and the other is used to check a condition.

### Try to find the solution to these expressions:

```c
x = 233; 
y = 122;

x == y;  // ?
x != y;  // ?
x < y;   // ?
x > y;   // ?
x <= y;  // ?
x >= y;  // ?
```

---

## The `sizeof` Operator

This operator tells you the size (in bytes) that a variable is using. This might seem useless at first, but believe me—this will be incredibly helpful when you're working with pointers and referencing memory.

This operator returns a `size_t` data type instead of `int`, since an `int` can be negative, but a size cannot be negative.

```c
int x = 23493247;
printf("%zu", sizeof x); // Your output will be 4 no matter how much you change the value. But... why?
```

Well, because *the `sizeof()` operator returns the size in bytes of the **type** of expression, not the size of the expression itself!*

> **Tip:** If you don't understand bytes, size, and memory-related concepts, you can refer to the ultra basics directory where I have covered these simple topics. Or you can just use ChatGPT or any other AI to explain each concept in detail.

**Warning:** Use AI to understand concepts—don't copy and paste mindlessly. You're smart enough to realize the difference.
