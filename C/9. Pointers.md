# Pointers

If you skipped the last part, then you'll find this confusing, so make sure you read the last section first.

People often find this topic complicated, even though it really isn't. As you can see from the name *Pointers*, we can assume it's something that points somewhere, and that is exactly the case.

Pointers are just a type of variable. You read that right—not a 'data type' but a type of 'variable'.

If pointers are a type of variable, then there must be a difference between them and regular variables. Regular variables are just names we give to memory addresses, but pointers introduce a slight twist.

> Suppose you are chatting with your friend. What you are typing to them is called a message. Now, what if they ask you for the address of another friend? You write that in a message too. That's exactly what a pointer is. The only difference between this analogy and the actual concept is that you don't name a message differently just because it contains an address—it is still a message.

Just like that, we have established that a pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable. 
Remember the cryptic memory address `0xd34535`? A pointer variable will store this kind of address instead of values like `39`, `334.23`, or `Hello World!`.

> But what's the point of even using this when we have a method (variables) that never requires us to deal with those cryptic letters? I'll explain that too, so hold on for a moment.

## Why didn't we make a data type for this? Wouldn't that be much better? Doesn't using this as a type of variable make it overcomplicated?

A pointer is not just storing an address; it also determines how much memory should be accessed and how the stored data should be interpreted. If the pointer’s type doesn’t match the variable’s type, the program might read the wrong amount of memory, leading to unpredictable behavior.

For example, an `int*` pointer expects to work with 4 bytes (on most systems), while a `char*` pointer expects 1 byte. If a `char*` pointer is mistakenly used to access an `int` variable, it would only read the first byte of the integer, leading to incorrect results.

> Imagine a bookshelf where each shelf is designed to hold books of a certain size. If you try to place a large book on a small shelf, it won’t fit properly, and if you place a small book on a large shelf, it might not be secure. Similarly, a pointer must be of the correct type to ensure it correctly references and retrieves the intended data.

## Declaring a Pointer

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int *pointer; // Declaration that the variable is a pointer by using *.
    return 0;
}
```

Just like variables, we can give them any name we desire [same rules as before]. The only difference is that we have to add an **asterisk (*)** to tell our compiler that it's a pointer, not a simple variable.

### Some Quick Basics:
- Pointers are not just for storing! You can access the data itself using the pointer. This means we can follow the pointer to access the data. We use the "&" (ampersand) operator, the same one used in the `scanf()` function.
- If you want to print the value a pointer holds, you can use the `%p` format specifier.

### Example Program

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int number = 340; // Integer variable
    int *ptr_to_number; // Integer pointer, not using this in this code
    
    printf("number is %d\n", number);
    printf("address where number is located in memory is %p\n", (void*)&number); // Wait, what?
}
```

Wait, what is this? For now, all you need to know is that we converted the `&number` type to `void*`. Just ignore `void` for now; I'll explain that later. When you run this code, you'll see the value of `number` in line 1 and an address in line 2. That is the exact memory address of `number` on your system! 

[If you convert that hexadecimal address, you'll find the exact index where the variable `number`'s data is stored.]

Now you know what a pointer is and how it differs from a normal variable! Instead of storing data itself, it lets you know where a variable is in memory. 

You should now be able to recognize pointers too (obviously because of `*`).

# Pointer Types

`int *ptr;`

So this is a pointer that'll point to other ints but how do we assign any variable's address to this? let's take a look.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
    int number = 42;  // initialization of var
    int *ptr_to_number;

    ptr_to_number = &number;  // storing the address of 'number', no need to use * if pointer is already declared
    printf("The pointer holds the address of number, which is: %p\n", (void*)ptr_to_number);

    return 0;
}
```
Now We have learned the basics of what pointer is the complicated stuff will begin from here on out so pay attention.
