# Memory

**If you're already familiar with how memory works in computers, you can skip this and move on to the next lesson on pointers. However, for beginners, this lesson is essential.**

##  What is Memory?

How does memory work? How does a computer determine how much memory it has and where it is located?

First, you need to understand one key concept: whether it's a **video, image, audio, text, or any other form of data**, everything is ultimately converted into basic units—**0s and 1s**. These are called **bits** (Binary Digits).

>  **For hardware basics of memory, watch this** [video](https://youtu.be/p3q5zWCw8J4?si=aKNdHre9D7PcsdMp).

A computer holds any form of data as long as there is a **sufficient number of bytes available**.

> **A byte** is a collection of **8 bits**.

## How Does a Computer Identify Memory?

Our CPU handles **millions of tasks simultaneously**—constantly rendering the GUI, displaying icons, running drivers, and executing background processes. So, how does it keep track of memory efficiently?

The answer is simple: it needs a way to identify each memory unit, and that method is called an **address**.

Just like every house has an address, every **byte in a memory block** also has a **unique address**. This allows the computer to locate and manage data efficiently.

To represent this address, our system uses **[hexadecimal format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)**.

## Memory Allocation and Data Types

Now, back to programming. Earlier, we discussed that the purpose of **data types** is to identify whether user input is a **character, string, number, or decimal**. While this is true, another important role of data types is **determining how much memory we allocate to a variable**.

For example, an `int` data type is allocated **4 bytes**. This means that even if we store a small number like `3` in an `int number`, it will still occupy **4 bytes** of memory.

Still a bit confused? Let's break it down further.

## What Does 4 Bytes Mean?

Earlier, we discussed that **1 byte = 8 bits**. This means that an `int`, which takes **4 bytes**, consists of:

> **4 bytes × 8 bits = 32 bits**

But what does this really mean? Imagine it like this:

```
< _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ >
```

Each **underscore (`_`)** represents a placeholder for either `0` or `1`. This is what **4 bytes** means! Any combination of **0s and 1s** that fits within this **32-bit limit** can be stored in that variable. 

**Kind of fascinating, right?**

## Data Types and Their Memory Size

### Remember the *format specifier* table? There were so many data types, right? Now let's expand on it even more!

| Format Specifier | Data Type | Memory Size (bytes) |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------|
| `%d` or `%i`    | Integer (`int`) | 4 |
| `%u`           | Unsigned integer (`unsigned int`) | 4 |
| `%hd`          | Short integer (`short int`) | 2 |
| `%hu`          | Unsigned short integer (`unsigned short int`) | 2 |
| `%ld`          | Long integer (`long int`) | 4 or 8 (system-dependent) |
| `%lu`          | Unsigned long integer (`unsigned long int`) | 4 or 8 |
| `%lld`         | Long long integer (`long long int`) | 8 |
| `%llu`         | Unsigned long long integer (`unsigned long long int`) | 8 |
| `%f`           | Floating point (`float`) | 4 |
| `%.2f`         | Floating point (2 decimal places) | 4 |
| `%lf`          | Double precision float (`double`) | 8 |
| `%Lf`          | Long double (`long double`) | 8, 12, or 16 (system-dependent) |
| `%c`           | Character (`char`) | 1 |
| `%s`           | String (`char[]`) | Varies (depends on length) |
| `%x` or `%X`   | Hexadecimal integer | 4 |
| `%o`           | Octal integer | 4 |
| `%p`           | Pointer address | 4 or 8 (system-dependent) |
| `%zu`          | `size_t` (used for `sizeof()`) | 4 or 8 (system-dependent) |

**Not all of these need to be memorized**—you'll primarily use only a few!

## System-Dependent Memory Sizes

Some data types, such as `long int`, `unsigned long int`, `pointers`, and `size_t`, are **system-dependent**:
- On a **32-bit system**, these types usually take **4 bytes**.
- On a **64-bit system**, they often take **8 bytes**.

Want to check your system type? Open **Settings** → Search for **About** → Look for **System Type** (either x32 or x64).

Want to find out through a program? You can use `%zu` with `sizeof()` to find the size of each data type!

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("An int uses %zu bytes\n", sizeof(int)); // Replace int with any data type
    return 0;
}
```

This will give you the specific number of bytes a data type uses on your system!

##  Why So Many Data Types?

1. If we always used `long long int` (8 bytes) for every integer, we'd **waste a lot of memory**. Instead:
- Use `char` (1 byte) for single characters.
- Use `short` (2 bytes) for small numbers.
- Use `int` (4 bytes) for general-purpose numbers.
- Use `long long` (8 bytes) only when needed.

2. Smaller data types **process faster** because they require fewer CPU cycles.

3. **Preventing Overflows**
Each data type has a **range** of values it can store:
- `short int` (2 bytes) → **-32,768 to 32,767**
- `int` (4 bytes) → **-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647**
- `long long` (8 bytes) → **Much larger range!**

4. Using the wrong data type may cause **overflow errors**!
