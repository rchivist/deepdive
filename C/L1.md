# What is an IDE?

An **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** is a feature-rich text editor that includes **syntax highlighting, extensions, debugging tools, and more**â€”things that a basic editor like Notepad lacks.

You can use **any IDE** you like. For beginners, I recommend **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, but feel free to choose whatever works best for you.

# What is GCC?

**GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** is a widely used compiler for C and other programming languages. A compiler converts human-readable code into machine code (binary) that the CPU can understand.

Even though C looks like readable text to us, it's just gibberish to a computer. The CPU only understands **0s and 1s**, so we need a compiler like **GCC** to translate our code into something the computer can execute.

To write and run C programs, you'll need both an **IDE** and a **compiler**. The most common C compiler is **GCC**, so I recommend installing it.

# Creating a C File

First, create a C file. If you don't know how, watch [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/FrkoRrhTQ7s?si=YeFJfjVjx9E-X1rj). After that write this code in your IDE, don't copy paste no matter what i know you are 
well aware of memes on internet showing that a senior developer is copy pasting stuff but you're not a senior
developer so don't do it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

# Understanding the "Hello, World!" C Program

Let's break down this simple C program step by step.

## 1. The `#include <stdio.h>` Directive

The first line:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

This is a **preprocessor directive**, meaning it is executed before the program is compiled. It imports the `stdio.h` header file, which contains pre-written C code, including the `printf()` function.

### What is `stdio.h`?

- `stdio.h` stands for **Standard Input/Output**.
- It provides functions for handling input and output in C.
- The `printf()` function, which we use in this program, is defined in `stdio.h`.

### Why do we need it?

Without including `stdio.h`, we wouldnâ€™t be able to use `printf()`. Writing such functionality from scratch would require **hundreds of lines of code**. By using pre-written functions, we make our program **more efficient and manageable**.

> **Tip:** Even though these functions are pre-written, it's beneficial to check out their implementations to understand how they work under the hood.

## 2. The `main()` Function

```c
int main(void) {}
```

- `main()` is the **entry point** of a C program.
- The keyword `int` indicates that the function returns an integer value.
- The `void` inside parentheses means that `main()` **does not take any arguments**.
- Everything inside `{}` (curly braces) belongs to the `main()` function.

---

## 3. Using `printf()`

```c
printf("Hello, World!\n");
```

- `printf()` is a function that prints text to the console.
- `"Hello, World!"` is the **argument** passed to `printf()`, specifying what to print.
- `\n` is an **escape sequence** that moves the cursor to the next line.

### What is an argument?

An **argument** is a value passed to a function when it is called. In this case, `"Hello, World!"` is passed to `printf()`, instructing it to print that text.

**Try removing `\n` and see how the output changes!**

---

## 4. The `return 0;` Statement

```c
return 0;
```

- This statement **ends** the `main()` function.
- Returning `0` typically indicates that the program executed **successfully**.

---

## 5. Closing the Function

The program ends when the closing `}` is reached. Any code written after this will be **outside** of the `main()` function.

---

This is how the **"Hello, World!"** program works in C! ðŸŽ‰
