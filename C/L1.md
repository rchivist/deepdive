# What is an IDE?

An **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** is a feature-rich text editor that includes **syntax highlighting, extensions, debugging tools, and more**â€”things that a basic editor like Notepad lacks.

You can use **any IDE** you like. For beginners, I recommend **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, but feel free to choose whatever works best for you.

# What is GCC?

**GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** is a widely used compiler for C and other programming languages. A compiler converts human-readable code into machine code (binary) that the CPU can understand.

Even though C looks like readable text to us, it's just gibberish to a computer. The CPU only understands **0s and 1s**, so we need a compiler like **GCC** to translate our code into something the computer can execute.

To write and run C programs, you'll need both an **IDE** and a **compiler**. The most common C compiler is **GCC**, so I recommend installing it.

# Hello, World!

This is a basic example of a C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
So, what's happening here? let's find out.
first line `c #include <stdio.h>` is a pre-process meaning this line of code will execute even before we run the program
so what is it doing? well it's importing a header file with pre written c code that has functions like printf(). stdio
means Standard Input/Output meaning this file has input and output functions of C language. in this program we are outputting a string "Hello, World"
so to use printf() we need to import/ include stdio.h file.
if we make a program from scratch { without importing any files } a simple program will take hundereds of lines as well
making it extremely inefficient that's why a pre written code is imported through files which makes it easy for user to program.
Note: Even though it's pre-written i recommend everyone to check out that code and understand how it works it's always helpful to know
how a function works under the hood. Where do you know that stdio.h file has printf() function? for that you have to read documentation.
i'll provide reference about that later.

second line is `c int main(void){} is initialization of function just like printf. it's your own function! and everything between
{} braces is part of the function definition. the void written in () is a argument and void means its nothing! 

third line is usage of a function printf() unlike main() this is not your function as we talked about it this function is included from
stdio header file! and we are calling the function ( basically using it ) and within that we are giving the argument.
what's an argument? imagine somewhere in stdio file there is a C program that has printf() function written.
which prints stuff on terminal for user. but how would it know that you want to print "Hello, World" ? 
what if we want to print 23 digit or some other string like my name? that's where argument comes in handy
basically an argument means whatever value you're passing in function call [ call means using the function ] it'll perform operations on that specific
argument! moving on... what's this \n ? basically it's telling the compiler to change the line. try running the code
