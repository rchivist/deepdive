# What is an IDE?

An **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** is a feature-rich text editor that includes **syntax highlighting, extensions, debugging tools, and more**â€”things that a basic editor like Notepad lacks.

You can use **any IDE** you like. For beginners, I recommend **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, but feel free to choose whatever works best for you.

# What is GCC?

**GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** is a widely used compiler for C and other programming languages. A compiler converts human-readable code into machine code (binary) that the CPU can understand.

Even though C looks like readable text to us, it's just gibberish to a computer. The CPU only understands **0s and 1s**, so we need a compiler like **GCC** to translate our code into something the computer can execute.

To write and run C programs, you'll need both an **IDE** and a **compiler**. The most common C compiler is **GCC**, so I recommend installing it.

# Hello, World!

This is a basic example of a C program:
