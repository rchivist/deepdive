# Functions

Finally, we have reached functions. So, what are functions? Why do we need to use them if we can do fine without them?

Well, functions are reusable blocks of code, meaning you can use them again and again without writing the whole logic repeatedly.

### Why do we need them?

> Look at it this way—you can look up a kindergarten book for A-Z when using alphabets *or* you can simply learn them! That way, you won't have to open and close the book again and again. Similarly, if you write a function instead of repeating logic multiple times, you can just type `function-name` and have the same logic at your disposal!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int func(int n) // Function definition
{
    return n + 1;
}
```

This is how we define a function! In place of *func*, you can write any name you'd like (except for a few exceptions). Before the function name, you must provide a data type so the compiler knows what type of value this function will return. *In this case, it returns an int.*

### Why the heck did we use `return`? We could've used `printf` instead!

Yes, but what if you are writing a function that you don't want to print immediately? When you click on a button in an application, you see the result it provides—not the intermediate values or processes!

So, how do we use it? Let's continue with the example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int func(int n) // Function definition
{
    return n + 1;
}

int main() {
    printf("%d", func(69)); // Printing the function while giving 69 as its argument
    return 0;
}
```

So, what the heck did we do??! Well, when you run the program, you'll get `70`.

Now you're slowly realizing what's really going on here. The way we wrote `func(69)`, it's called a **function call**. Instead of making a variable, storing a value, doing `+1`, and then printing, we simply called `func(69)`—and boom! We got `70`. How?

Notice that in `func()` we wrote `int n` and then returned `n + 1`. This is the magic! When we call the function, the compiler relates the value given in the function to the actual block of code we wrote. If the data types match, it executes whatever is inside the function. Otherwise, it'll throw an error.

---

### But what if we don't know what value our function is going to return?

I mean, it's completely possible that this situation arises. So what do we do? Well, we use `void`. Let's see an example!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void func(int n) // Void function
{
    printf("%d", n + 1); // Prints the added value!
}

int main() {
    func(69); // Calls the function
    return 0;
}
```

Everything has changed. Let me explain it.

Before using `void`, we were printing the value just by calling a function. Why? Because we could! We had the privilege of `return`, which provides the result when we call a function! I repeat—it **provides** the value. Not prints, not stores—it **provides**. This means we can store it in a variable, call it again and again, and do a whole lot more.

But when `void` came into the picture, we lost that privilege! We **can't** use `return` values inside a void function, meaning if we want to print something, we have to do it **inside** the function! We can still create logic, perform operations, and more, but we can't get the value directly into some other function. We can print it, but as you can see, that's only possible **within** the `void` function.

# Arguments

Let's see a function first:

```c
int tester(int x, int y) {
    return x + (y * 2); // A basic mathematical expression
}
```

You've seen me go on and on about arguments, but I'm sure you still can't figure out their purpose. Why do we use them?

I think the reason for confusion usually comes from terminology. We could've called it "value-pass," but instead, we call it an argument. Whenever we write single or multiple values in the function call, our function takes those values and **correlates** them to the actual function definition, its logic, and all other stuff. It sees and notices:

> "Huh, well, the user called this function and gave arguments like `tester(2, 6)`, and if I see the code of `tester()`, it has `int x, int y` as variables defined... So x and y should be `int`, and 2 and 6 are also `int`, so it's all good. Now let's see what we have to do.
>
> Let's assign `x = 2` and `y = 6`. {It'll assign values in the same order we give arguments!}
>
> Now let's do what `tester()` should do—add `2` to double of `6`! --> `2 + (6 * 2) = 14`. So I'll return `14`. But wait, is it an `int`? Oh yes, `14` is an integer, and since the user wrote `int tester(){...}` and not `char tester(){...}`, that means it's correct! So I'll return it and not throw an error."
```
```
using `void` as arguments means that the function does not accept any arguements, Meaning don't give it any value or stuff just call it!


Now you've understood basics we're gonna dive into technical stuff now. But before that there is one simple thing i didn't mentioned you so that you can undersand everything easily first it's kind of important too.
### Passing by value instead of hard-coded values

> We call those values we pass inside function calls *arguments* if and only if we are calling it! Not when we  are defining it. When we define it whatever variables we declare... we call them parameters.So remember this. You must be thinking "This is so damn confusing! Why don't we call them with the same name, wouldn't that be much more easier?" Well yes it would be but there is one very very crucial reason why we don't do this. try to think why is that? i'll give you a hint : *We would call two things with different names only if they are not the same!* Now you must be thinking "wait! what are you talking about didn't you said it correlates and work with values we give them during calling of the function? so how are they different? The reason is because THEY ARE NOT! No matter the circumstance a function always works with the copy if we pass a variable instead of hard-coded values like we did `tester(2, 6)` see we wrote two integers hard-coded. I'll explain more clearly with examples.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void increment(int a)
{
    a++; // Adds 1 to a 
}

int main(void)
{
    int x = 10;

    increment(x); // Calls the function

    printf("x = %d", x);  // What does this print?
}
```
At first glance, it looks like i is 10, and we pass it to increment(). Inside that function, the value increases, so when we print it, it should be 11, right?

NOPE. Get used to disappointment.

It prints 10. But why??

It’s all about the fact that whatever you pass to a function gets copied into its corresponding parameter. The function works on that copy, not the original value.

Here’s what happens:

    - i is 10 in main().
    - We pass i to increment(), which has a parameter called a.
    - The copy happens: a = i → Now a is 10, and i is also 10 (but in a different memory location).
    - We do a++, so a becomes 11.
    - But i? Still 10! We never changed i, we only changed a (which is a separate copy).
    - The function ends, and all its local variables (including a) are discarded.
    - i in main() is still 10, and that’s what gets printed.

So yeah, functions don’t modify the original value unless you explicitly return something.

If you really want to modify the original value? You’ll need to use passing by reference. But we'll talk about that later on.

if you're still confused then it's fine you'll understand everything after **Pointers** just remember this rule for now:
 *EVERYTHING you pass to a function, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, is copied. The function works on the copy, not the original. No shortcuts. No tricks.*


# Function Prototypes

## What if we want to define `main` first so that people can see the main logic first, then our mini-functions with their functionalities?

If you want to do this, then you have to first give a **prototype**. By doing that, you're notifying the compiler that you're going to call a function in `main` that's defined later. This way, the compiler won't throw an error. Let's see an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int number(void);  // A function prototype

int main(void)
{
    int i;
    i = number(); // Even though we have written no logic for number() yet, we can still call it since we gave a prototype to the compiler!
    
    printf("%d\n", i);  // 0927
}

int number(void)  // This is the actual logic of number() we wrote after main
{
    return 0927;
}
```

> Look at it this way: A person won't invest in your company if you don't give them an idea first! Similarly, a compiler won't let you run a function if you don't notify it first or define it!


>**Tip:** You must've seen code where people declare a function with 0 parameters—not even void! They think, "If void means nothing, then I'll just pass on literally nothing!" And yeah, the code will still run...BUT DON'T DO THAT! There's a reason void exists, and that reason is important. Leaving void out of the prototype tells the compiler, "Hey, I have no clue what parameters this function might take!" This effectively turns off all type checking, which can lead to weird, hard-to-debug issues it won't happen on your level but someday it will. So, always use void if a function takes no parameters—it's there for a reason!

#### Projects[ it doesn't have project ideas so skip it if you want to ]:

    I'll share something important with you—most programmers regret not starting early. I mean, if you see a 19-year-old writing bash scripts in Neovim, you'll probably feel a little imposter syndrome too!
    But here's the funny thing—no matter how far ahead someone is, unless they have a photographic memory, you can always catch up!

Well... unless you get hit by a car—then that's a different story.

The point is, you can always catch up, but there's a condition. You'll have to learn differently. They started at an age when you were probably drooling food and watching cartoons. They had the luxury of sitting around, sometimes watching stuff, sometimes just randomly messing with things that were completely useless in terms of learning.

That means learning was fun for them—but it won't be for you... not unless you start enjoying the process itself, just like they did.

I mean, there's a reason you were drooling and they were learning—it all comes down to interest and priorities. So, if you really want to get better, you have to be interested. Otherwise, it won't matter how many tutorials you watch.

And if you are interested, I’ll give you just one tip:
"Build projects as much as you can."

Any random person can play an 18-hour-long C++ tutorial and watch it in a week while cooking food or doing something else. But they’ll never be able to beat the person who watched that same tutorial while actually writing code, coming up with project ideas, and building them.

It doesn’t matter if you fail—you just have to try.
