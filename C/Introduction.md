Hello, and welcome!

In these lessons, I’ll be guiding you through learning C programming from the basics to more advanced concepts.
A Quick Note

I’m not an expert—just someone sharing what I’ve learned. If I make a mistake, feel free to create an issue in this repository or email me at shivang.arya91@gmail.com.
How This Guide Works

    Each directory contains multiple lessons, starting from the fundamentals and progressively diving deeper.
    It’s highly recommended to use an IDE while following along.
    Type the code yourself! Even if you have to reference it multiple times, that’s completely fine. Learning happens through practice.

Final Project

At the end of each section, I’ll create a larger project to apply what we’ve learned. If you stick around that long, I recommend not looking at the final code immediately—instead, follow the instructions, understand the logic, and build it step by step.
