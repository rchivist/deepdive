# Loops

What are loops? You can take an easy guess—it has something to do with repetition [It's named *loops* obviously]. And you'd be correct, but that's just surface level. The way these work is really interesting. Remember when we talked about printing `Hello, World!` 100,000 times? We'll learn about each type by solving this!

There are three kinds of loops, and you'll only need to learn two of them, but for the sake of learning, we'll dive into all three: *for*, *while*, and *do-while*.

### For Loop

These are by far the most common. You'll encounter them everywhere. They also get very tricky when you try to solve pattern programs [making patterns like stars, diamonds, etc.]. Let's try to print "Hello, World!" 100,000 times.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int i; // Variable declaration!
    
    for(i = 0; i <= 100000; i++){ // Actual loop 
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
    }
}
```

> Try to read this as a sentence! *For i is 0, keep adding 1 to i until it reaches 100000.* This way, it starts a sort of counter: 1, 2, 3, 4, ..... 100000. Each time this counter increases, whatever we wrote inside `{}` braces of `for()` will execute. In our case, it keeps printing "Hello, World!".

Let's repeat—this line of code creates a counter construct! We know `i++` means `i = i + 1`, so the first time "Hello, World!" prints, the loop starts again but with a minor difference—we added 1 to `i`, so the value of `i` became 1 instead of 0. It prints "Hello, World!" again and adds 1 to `i` (which is also 1 now), making it 2. While doing this, it also keeps checking the condition `1 <= 100000`. Then it repeats this until we reach that condition! As soon as the condition becomes false, the loop breaks and we move on. 

If you're keen, you'll notice that I'm starting the loop from 0 and ending at 100000. Wouldn't that print "Hello, World!" 100001 times? Yes, it will—so fix that yourself!

> **Tip:** Instead of `int i;`, we could've just declared `i` in our for loop line like this: `for (int i = 1; i <= 100000; i++)`

### While Loop

Funny thing is, if you understood `for` loops, the rest of them are easy—just the syntax is different!

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int i = 0; // Variable declaration and initialization
    
    while(i <= 100000){ // Condition check
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
        i++; // Adding 1 to i
    }
}
```
Now try to find the similarities between `for` and `while` loops by comparing both programs.

> Try to read this as a sentence as well! *While our initialized `i` is less than or equal to 100000, I want to print "Hello, World!" and then increase the value of `i` by 1.* This way, the loop will continue until the 100001st iteration and then break! Yes, it will also do this if you start from 0.

### Do-While Loop

It's rarely used in programming, but it never hurts to learn.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int i = 0; // Variable declaration and initialization

    do {
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
        i++;
    } 
    while(i <= 100000); // Condition check
}
```

> *Do* print "Hello, World!" and add 1 to `i`, *while* `i <= 100000`. It's kind of tricky to understand, but look at it this way: before, we were starting the counter first and then executing the code. But in this case, we execute the code at least once and then check the condition `while`. By this logic, we can also establish that unlike `for` and `while` loops, this will execute the loop **100002 times**!
