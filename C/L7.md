# Making a basic CLI (Command Line Interface) Calculator

Instead of Looking at the code first see the problem, break it down and then approach the broken chunks of problem. In this case - 

**WE HAVE TO MAKE A CALCULATOR**
That means, 
    We have to prompt for user input of numbers!

    Then we have to ask user what do they want to do with those?? Do we have to add, subtract or divide? *of course we can do all at once but that's inefficient! *you can do all the undergraduate degrees but you only chose one right? Then why do you want to perform all operations if user only wants one.*

    We can make a good use of functions now by creating functions of each operation! that'll make our code look simple and easy to read!

*Note:* For now i will take only 2 numbers as input and then perform operation on them { Whichever user chooses! }. If you want something like a legit calculator that takes several numbers as much as it can and keep performing calculations! we can do that too and we will but not today. you are welcome to try on your own but we are still in beginner phase. Also read comments too! there's a reason i added those.

Now let's start --

```c
// Preprocessor directives
#include <stdio.h>  // Standard input/output
#include <math.h>   // Math library

/* 
   Function prototypes - declared first so that the compiler knows they exist.
   Since we're dealing with user input, we should expect decimal values too.
   We'll use `double` to handle both floating values and large numbers.
*/
double addition(double x, double y);
double subtraction(double x, double y);
double division(double x, double y);
double multiplication(double x, double y);
double modulus(double x, double y);
double power(double x, double y);

int main(void) {
    double first, second;
    char operation;

    printf("Enter first number for operation: ");
    scanf("%lf", &first); // taking double input

    printf("Enter second number for operation: ");
    scanf("%lf", &second);

    printf("You have successfully entered two numbers!\n");
    printf("Now type in the symbol of the operation you want to perform:\n");
    printf(" 1. '+' for addition\n 2. '-' for subtraction\n 3. '*' for multiplication\n");
    printf(" 4. '/' for division\n 5. '%%' for modulus\n 6. '^' for power\n");

    scanf(" %c", &operation); // Watch this line carefully! Notice how i gave and space "<space> %c" there is a reason for this too i'll explain it later.

    switch (operation) {
        case '+':
            printf("Addition is: %lf\n", addition(first, second));
            break;

        case '-':
            printf("Subtraction is: %lf\n", subtraction(first, second));
            break;

        case '*':
            printf("Multiplication is: %lf\n", multiplication(first, second));
            break;

        case '/':
            if (second == 0) {
                printf("division by zero is undefined.\n");
            } else {
                printf("Division is: %lf\n", division(first, second));
            }
            break;

        case '%': // Mod operation
            if (second == 0) {
                printf("Mod by zero is undefined.\n");
            } else {
                printf("Modulus is: %lf\n", modulus(first, second));
            }
            break;

        case '^': // Power operation
            printf("Power result: %lf\n", power(first, second));
            break;

        default:
            printf("Invalid operation! Please enter a valid symbol.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

// Defining functions

double addition(double x, double y) {
    return x + y;
}

double subtraction(double x, double y) {
    return x - y;
}

double division(double x, double y) {
    return x / y;
}

double multiplication(double x, double y) {
    return x * y;
}

double modulus(double x, double y) {
    return fmod(x, y);  // fmod() function is from math.h header file!
}

double power(double x, double y) {
    return pow(x, y);  // pow() function is from math.h header file too!
}
```

That's it! We just made a fully functioning basic calculator. If you're trying this on your own, you'll run into a bunch of errors, and that's a good thing—this is how you learn.

Everything we've been learning so far was just combined with a few ideas to create something useful. This is the essence of programming. Although we skipped a lot of things we could improve upon, you're a beginner, so that's okay.

I highly recommend saving your code and continuously upgrading it as we explore more topics. Keep modifying this program to make it more robust. At some point, you'll learn about exception handling , and that's when things will really start to make sense.

For now, here’s a rough idea: try-except is used to catch every possible mistake a user might make! We already handled division by zero and modulus by zero, but what if the user enters letters instead of numbers? We can't stop them from doing that!

Another improvement could be looping the program so that it doesn’t exit after just one operation. There’s so much more we can do, even with a basic calculator.

That's why I suggest keeping this code saved and writing down your ideas in comments so you can upgrade it as you progress
